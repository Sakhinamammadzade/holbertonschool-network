# Networking Concepts Overview

Welcome to the Networking Concepts Repository! This repository covers fundamental concepts related to computer networking. Each topic provides insights into various aspects of networking protocols, addresses, and communication models.

## Topics Overview

0. [OSI Model](./0-OSI_model)
   - Description: The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) Model is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a telecommunication or computing system. It defines seven abstraction layers that facilitate interoperability between different networking systems.

1. [Types of Network](./1-types_of_network)
   - Description: This topic explores different types of computer networks, including LANs (Local Area Networks), WANs (Wide Area Networks), MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks), and PANs (Personal Area Networks). It covers their characteristics, applications, and typical implementations.

2. [MAC and IP Address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
   - Description: MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are fundamental concepts in networking. This topic delves into the differences between them, their formats, how they are assigned, and their roles in the networking ecosystem.

3. [UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
   - Description: UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are two prominent transport layer protocols in the OSI Model. This topic discusses their characteristics, differences, use cases, and advantages/disadvantages in various networking scenarios.

4. [TCP and UDP Ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
   - Description: TCP and UDP utilize ports to enable communication between applications. This topic explains what ports are, how they work, the difference between TCP and UDP ports, and how they are used to establish connections between devices.

5. [Is the Host on the Network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
   - Description: Determining whether a host is on the network is a crucial aspect of network administration and troubleshooting. This topic covers techniques such as ping, ARP (Address Resolution Protocol), and network scanning to determine the presence and accessibility of hosts on a network.
