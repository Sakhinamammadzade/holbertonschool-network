# Networking Concepts Overview

Welcome to the Networking Concepts Repository! This repository covers fundamental concepts related to computer networking. Each topic provides insights into various aspects of networking protocols, addresses, and communication models.

## Topics Overview

0. [OSI Model](./0-OSI_model)
The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with adjacent layers. This section provides an overview of the OSI model and its layers.

1. [Types of Network](./1-types_of_network)
This section discusses different types of computer networks, including LANs (Local Area Networks), WANs (Wide Area Networks), MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks), WLANs (Wireless Local Area Networks), and others. It covers the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of each type of network.

2. [MAC and IP Address](./2-MAC_and_IP_address)
MAC (Media Access Control) addresses and IP (Internet Protocol) addresses are essential components of network communication. This section explains the differences between MAC and IP addresses, their formats, and how they are used in networking.

3.  [UDP and TCP](./3-UDP_and_TCP)
UDP (User Datagram Protocol) and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) are two primary transport layer protocols used for data transmission over networks. This section explores the differences between UDP and TCP, their features, and when to use each protocol based on specific requirements.

4. [TCP and UDP Ports](./4-TCP_and_UDP_ports)
TCP and UDP use ports to enable communication between devices on a network. This section delves into TCP and UDP ports, how they work, and their significance in network communication.

5.[Is the Host on the Network](./5-is_the_host_on_the_network)
Determining whether a host is reachable on a network involves various techniques and tools. This section covers methods for checking the reachability of a host, including using ping, traceroute, and other network diagnostic tools.
